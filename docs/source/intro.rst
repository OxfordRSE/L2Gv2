Introduction
============

Setup
-----

**Supported Python Versions**: 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 

**Supported Operating Systems**: macOS, Linux  

Clone the repository on your machine

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/lotzma/L2Gv2.git

Setup the virtual environment

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   .. code-block:: bash

       python3 -m venv .venv
       source .venv/bin/activate

2. Install the dependencies:

   .. code-block:: bash

       pip install -r requirements.txt

The unified ``requirements.in`` file includes both shared and platform-specific dependencies with version constraints where necessary. To update dependencies, modify ``requirements.in`` and then recompile ``requirements.txt``:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip-compile requirements.in --verbose

GitHub actions & pre-commit integration
------------------------------------------

This project uses `pylint` for code quality and linting checks, integrated with both GitHub Actions for continuous integration and `pre-commit` (`pre-commit.com <href https://pre-commit.com>`_) for local development checks.

The pylint GitHub workflow file is located at ``.github/workflows/pylint.yml`` 

The `pre-commit` hook is set up to automatically run `pylint` on files within the ``l2gv2`` folder whenever code is committed locally (``.pre-commit-config.yaml``). This helps catch and resolve linting issues before they are pushed to the repository. 

To set up the pre-commit hook

1. Install `pre-commit` if itâ€™s not already installed:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install pre-commit

2. Install the pre-commit hooks defined in the configuration file:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pre-commit install

3. Run the `pre-commit` hooks manually to check all files:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pre-commit run --all-files


Documentation
-------------

The project is setup to generate documentation with `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html>`_). 

Documentation is available at `l2gv2.readthedocs.io <https://l2gv2.readthedocs.io>`_

Generate the package documentation

.. code-block:: bash

   sphinx-apidoc -o docs/source/reference -H "Code Reference" l2gv2

Generate `html` or `markdown` documentation locally

.. code-block:: bash

   sphinx-build html docs/source/ docs/build/
   sphinx-build markdown docs/source/ docs/build/

Automatically refresh and serve the html documentation locally at `http://127.0.0.1:8000 <http://127.0.0.1:8000>`_ upon file updates during development

.. code-block:: bash
   
   sphinx-autobuild docs/source docs/build/html
