Overview
============

The `l2gv2` package is a framework for scalable graph
representation learning, implementing algorithms such as the one depicted in

Traditional centralized graph representation learning methods do not scale well
 to large graphs, which do not fit into memory. The core idea of local2global
algorithms (both the one presented above, and a new algorithm developed in this
package) is to divide a large graph into smaller, overlapping subgraphs --
referred to as *patches* and learn local embeddings independently. These *local*
embeddings are then aligned by learning appropriate transformations between
patches so that the patches can be made to overlap in a shared global embedding.
Alignment takes place by inferring appropriate transformation matrices for
rescaling, rotation and translation as shown in the figure below, adapted from
the Local2Global paper.

This library implements local2global algorithms, allowing patches to be
processed independently. The library includes methods for graph partitioning,
local embedding generation using popular graph neural network (GNN) models such
as Graph AutoEncoders (GAE), and algorithms for global alignment. We
also show the application of the library in correctly estimating global
embeddings for well-known graph neural network models in the literature, such as
the [Cora](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1009953814988) dataset of
machine learning citations and the [DGraph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03579)
financial dataset.


Installation
------------

We support Python versions 3.10 - 3.12 on macOS and Linux.

The recommended installation method is by using a Python package manager. We publish packages to PyPi under the `TODO` name. For example, to install in a virtual environment using `pip`:

```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install TODO
```

To use a package manager such as `uv` or `poetry`:

```shell
uv add TODO
poetry add TODO
```

Alternatively you can manually specify the package requirement in a `requirements.txt`:

```
TODO==0.1.0
```

Or, in the more modern `pyproject.toml` format:

```toml
dependencies = ["TODO==0.1.0"]
```

See the [demonstration Jupyter notebook](demo) to see how the library is structured and used.
